## Maze AI Project Todo List

### Phase 1: Project setup and maze environment creation
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Define maze representation
- [ ] Implement maze generation (optional, can use predefined mazes)
- [x] Implement environment (states, actions, rewards)
### Phase 2: Implement reinforcement learning algorithm
- [x] Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA)
- [x] Implement the chosen RL algorithm
- [x] Define agent's policy (e.g., epsilon-greedy)### Phase 3: Train the AI agent and visualize results
- [x] Set up training loop
- [x] Train the agent in the maze environment
- [x] Implement visualization of agent's learning progress (e.g., reward per episode)
- [x] Implement visualization of agent's path in the maze

### Phase 4: Create interactive demonstration and documentation
- [x] Develop a simple web interface for demonstration
- [x] Allow users to interact with the trained agent
- [x] Write comprehensive documentation for the project

### Phase 5: Deliver project results to user
- [x] Package the project for delivery
- [x] Provide instructions for running the project
- [x] Present the project to the user
